            <p>
              The origin of the records to follow in this series can be traced back to my notebooks where I used to
              quote lengthy paragraphs from my readings in college. Initially, these notebooks were designed as a
              repository of thought, and more precisely, as a treasury of ideas for an academic career in humanities.
              Thus, unlike the illegible notes taken in course seminars, these soft-cover black notebooks would
              include only a small amount of my own commentary, so that the purity of ideas is preserved for future
              inspiration.
            </p>
            <p>
              No wonder I hardly remember reading many of these pieces that I once put there with such detail. What is
              surprising is that reading them today does not reveal an idea from the past, nor does it provide a new
              perspective on a past thought. The object of primary interest, it is revealed, is not the external idea,
              but the very subject that thought these passages are worth saving for some future time; namely, myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, looking back at these notebooks, it feels as if I am looking at a memory of myself at a time when I
              was not able to understand the paths of my own thinking. I can now see certain paths that I took then, but
              such a vision comes along with a thrilling sense of blindness towards the paths that I am taking at this
              very moment while I am trying to make sense of the paths that I took in the past. Of course, the notebooks
              tell me that this is to be expected; here is an entry (dated September 2, 2017) featuring a quote from
              <cite>In the Language of Walter Benjamin</cite> by Carol Jacobs.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote--quote">
              For Benjamin, remembrance is no instrument for digging up and taking hold of an ex-ternal past. Memories
              are, rather, a medium in which debris and buried ruins are rein-terred as one probes; a digging in which
              no thing is brought to the surface. And yet Ben-jamin hardly bemoans a loss of treasure, but celebrates,
              rather, the dark good fortune of the digging itself and even the failure to find. (11)
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              If you are keen on reducing temporal difference into a spatial metaphor, an understanding of perspective
              may prove to be productive here. So, here is another entry (dated September 28, 2017) featuring a quote
              from <cite>Perspective as Symbolic Form</cite> by Erwin Panofsky:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote--quote">
              Perspective creates distance between human beings and things (“the first is the eye that sees, the second
              is the objects seen, the third is the distance between them,” says Dürer after Piero della Francesca); but
              then in turn it abolishes the distance by, in a sense, drawing this world of things, an autonomous world
              confronting the individual, into the eye. Thus, the history of perspective may be understood with equal
              justice as a triumph of the distance-denying human struggle for control; it is as much a consolidation and
              systematization of the external world, as an extension of the domain of the self. (67-68)
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Then, it might follow that the first is the self that remembers, the second is the self that is
              remembered, and the third is the distance between them. When the distance reveals itself, it defies the
              triumph of the distance-denying human struggle for control; the past self which was formerly an
              extension of the domain of the self, becomes apparent as an autonomous object confronting the individual.
              The only way forward, however, is another perspective that re-establishes the control of the domain of the
              self over the past.
            </p>
            <p>
              Considering Panofsky’s emphasis on “the distance-denying human struggle for control,” it is then probably
              not a coincidence that another entry (dated November 6, 2017) refers to Wilhelm von Humboldt’s idea of
              Bildung, i.e., self-cultivation.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote--quote">
              Although all these demands are limited to man’s inner being, his nature drives him to reach beyond
              himself to the external objects, and here it is crucial that he should not lose himself in this
              alienation, but rather reflect back into his inner being the clarifying light and the comforting warmth of
              everything that he undertakes outside himself. To this end, however, he must bring the mass of objects
              closer to himself, impress his mind upon this matter, and create more of a resemblance between the two.
              (Humboldt 59)
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Alienation, confrontation, consolidation… such are the side effects of reading yourself. Here, however,
              my
              purpose is to merely think aloud and celebrate the dark good fortune of the digging itself.
